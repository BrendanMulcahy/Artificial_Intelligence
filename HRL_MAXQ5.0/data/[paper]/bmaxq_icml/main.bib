		  hierarchical classification that simplifies the process of
		  finding the right database for any given task. The growing
		  number of databases related to immunology, plant and
		  organelle research have been accommodated by separating
		  them into three new categories. The database summaries
		  provide brief descriptions of the databases, contact
		  details, appropriate references and acknowledgements. The
		  online summaries also serve as a venue for the maintainers
		  of each database to introduce database updates and other
		  improvements in the scope and tools. These updates are
		  particularly important for those databases that have not
		  been described in print in the recent past. The database

		  database (MYGD) extended by functional analysis data, the
		  database of annotated human EST-clusters (HIB) and the
		  database of the complete cDNA sequences from the DHGP
		  (German Human Genome Project). It also contains information
		  on the up-to-date database of complete genomes (PEDANT),
		  the classification of protein sequ! ences (ProtFam) and the
